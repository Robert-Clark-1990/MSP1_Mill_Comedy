                    <br>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        Milly Armstrong Clark is a Yorkshire comedian born and raised in the quaint town of Malton. Throughout her early years, she loved nothing more than to film herself pretending to be elderly women,
                        which scientists believe may be a defect caused by consuming literally nothing but Yorkshire Tea and pickled gherkins since birth.         
                        <br><br> 
                        Milly got into stand up in 2019 as a way to subsidise her Yorkshire Tea addiction and avoid having to get a "real" job. Her style has been described as loveably quriky and accidentally intellectual.
                        Pulling anicdotes from her mildly ridiculous life, Milly weaves a hilarious narrative with observations of her encounters - from sex shop drive bys to 3am cake baking sessions - and a splash of the delightfully macabre to offer a unique and side-splitting performance.
                        Her first gig was in York, shortly after she was wrongfully accused of telling a small woman to go back to the circus, so every gig since has been a massive improvement by simply not being shouted at in a queue.
                        <br><br>
                        When Milly isn't up on stage, she hosts a weekly podcast <a class="link-plug" href="podcast.html">Tea with the Morale Queen</a> in which she sits down with a new guest each week to share positive
                        and morale-boosting stories over a good cuppa. Her guests come from all walks of life, and are guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
                        <br><br>
                        Ever the Jack of all trades, Milly is also writing a sitcom based on the goings on at a seaside campsite (keep an eye out for it on TV), and is writing a part-autobiographical, 
                        part-wild musings book entitled "Tales from under the Carrot Tree", which is due for release in all your local bookstores just as soon as she finishes writing the damn thing.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of her comedic and creative pursuits, Milly is passionate about animals and wildlife. Milly attended the University of Cumbria, where she studied a degree in Wildlife and Media. 
                        Her history includes a year-long volunteer apprenticeship with the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, working at two vetinary surgeries in Yorkshire, handling with Birds of Prey, and working with the Cats Protection. 
                        Milly has been involved in various fundraising projects to help a great number of wildlife and animal organisations, and is always keen to find ways to merge her passions together.
                        <br><br>
                        Milly lives with her band of waifs and strays, including husband Rob, a golden retriever called Poppy (or sometimes Div dog), two cats named Xena and Kya, and a bearded dragon called Ziggard Christoper Stark Junior (or Ziggy for short).
